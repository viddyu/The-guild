// Necessary documentation to authenticate a user is listed below.

// To request an authorization code, 
// you must direct the user's browser to LinkedIn's
// OAuth 2.0 authorization endpoint.  
// Once the request is made, 
// one of the following two situations will occur:

// 1. If the user has not previously accepted the application's permission request, 
// or the grant has expired or been manually revoked by the user, 
// the browser will be redirected to LinkedIn's authorization screen (shown here: https://developer.linkedin.com/docs/oauth2).  
// When the user completes the authorization process, the browser is redirected 
// to the URL provided in the redirect_uri query parameter.

// 2. If there is a valid existing permission grant from the user, 
// the authorization screen is by-passed and 
// the user is immediately redirected to the URL provided in the redirect_uri query parameter.

// When the user provides valid Linkedin credentials and clicks the "Allow Access" button,
// they approve your app's request to access their member data and interact with Linkedin
// Linkedin then sends the user back to the callback url you defined in redirect_uri
